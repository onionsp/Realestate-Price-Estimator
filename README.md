Building upon the NBA MVP predictor, I am focusing on an end to end ML project that goes through data cleaning, exploration and predictions. 
This is still a regression task but uses a dataset sourced on kaggle which has realestate data for different Melbourne suburbs. 
The goal of this project is to accurately predict median house prices in each suburb.
